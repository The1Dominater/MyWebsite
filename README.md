# My Personal Website
Built by Dominic Galgano

Hosted by GitHub Pages

DNS subdomain provided by [freedns.afraid.org](https://freedns.afraid.org)

### Description
This is the code I use to run my personal website, which I built from scratch. There are two versions I have setup:
  1. Uses Flask and Jinja to load the HTML templates. It uses reCAPTHCA and contains an dynamic contact form page. It was designed to be hosted using locally or on Cloud based resources such as GCP
  2. Uses pure HTML with no templates to host a completely static (but very similar) version of the site, ultimately because it was more cost effective for me. Unfortunately, it does not demonstrate any of the cool dynamic features, but still contains all the information you need to know about me!

### How to Access
I setup this website to run using a custom domain name using No-IP's free 1 free domain name
option. Visit this URL: [dwg.port0.org](http://dwg.port0.org)
